*Please don't copy my work and use it for your project! Use it to get an idea of how it was done and come up with your own code!! 

*This repository will include projects and assignments from CMSC140 as well as lab assignments.  

* All my work has been modified for uploading purposes. The modifications include name changes, no college name on documentation,
professors name removed. The reason for this is because I do not want people finding out what school I attend nor do I want share my 
real name with anyone unless it is for business purposes such as a job offer or internship. 

*If you have any questions for me feel free to message me!! Thank you!
